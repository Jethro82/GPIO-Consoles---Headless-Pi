# GPIO-Consoles---Headless-Pi
Some utilities I'm designing so that my 7 1/2 year old nephew can control circuits from the pi without writing a line of code.
They might be of some use to others.  I have to use visudo to change www-data to a sudo user - really not ideal
If anyone knows how to do this without the use of sudo please let me know
